**README**

`Pollputers` is an app made to allow users to submit their computer brand and other features through the website.

While it's in early stage development all the CRUD function works.

There is no account system yet so every model in the database can be controlled using the website 

The `Pollputers` main page will display a list of every thing in the database with a button to create a new one,
you can also click on any item in the list to delete or update it
